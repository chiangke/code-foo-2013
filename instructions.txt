From the 2010 US Census:
San Francisco Bay Area total population - 7,150,000
From NPD's 2012 report "Gamer Segmentation 2012: The New Faces of Gamers"
Total gamers in the US - 211,500,000 
US total population - 315,750,000
= gamers make up 2/3 of the US population 

Assuming our definition of gamer includes NPD's categories
of Mobile, Digital, Core, Light/Avid PC, Family&Kid gamers,
and using the estimate that 2/3 of the US population plays games,
we arrive at an estimate of 4,700,000 gamers in the Bay Area (2/3 of the Bay Area population)
